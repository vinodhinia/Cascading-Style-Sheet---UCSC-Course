        experience developing web application projects in JAVA technology. In my work most of the time I have spent working on backend stuffs
        I have very little knowledge about Frontedn styling validation. I wanted to know how things work. To learn more about styling I have enrolled
        in Desinging Cascading stlye sheet fundamentals.

        Here is my favourite concept in JAVA:
        The collections framework was designed to meet several goals, such as −
        The framework had to be high-performance. The implementations for the fundamental collections (dynamic arrays, linked lists, trees, and hashtables) were to
        be highly efficient.The framework had to allow different types of collections to work in a similar manner and with a high degree of interoperability.
        The framework had to extend and/or adapt a collection easily.
    </p>
    <p>

        Towards this end, the entire collections framework is designed around a set of standard interfaces. Several standard implementations such as <span>LinkedList, HashSet, and TreeSet </span>,of these
        interfaces are provided that you may use as-is and you may also implement your own collection, if you choose.
        A collections framework is a unified architecture for representing and manipulating collections.

    <p>
        Java is a general-purpose computer programming language that is concurrent, class-based, object-oriented,[14] and specifically designed to have as few implementation dependencies as possible.
        It is intended to let application developers "write once, run anywhere" (WORA),meaning that compiled Java code can run on all platforms that support Java without the need for recompilation.
        Java applications are typically compiled to bytecode that can run on
        any <span>Java virtual machine (JVM)</span> regardless of computer architecture. As of 2016, Java is one of the most popular programming languages in use,[17][18][19][20] particularly for client-server web applications,
        with a reported 9 million developers.Java was originally developed by James Gosling at Sun Microsystems (which has since been acquired by Oracle Corporation) and released in 1995 as a core component of Sun
        Microsystems' Java platform. The language derives much of its syntax from C and C++, but it has fewer low-level facilities than either of them.
    </p>
    <p>
        The original and reference implementation Java compilers, virtual machines, and class libraries were originally released by Sun under proprietary licenses. As of May 2007, in compliance with the specifications
        of the Java Community Process, Sun relicensed most of its Java technologies under the GNU General Public License. Others have also developed alternative implementations of these Sun technologies, such as the GNU Compiler for Java (bytecode compiler), GNU Classpath (standard libraries),
        and IcedTea-Web (browser plugin for applets).
