<p> Hello, I am Vinodhini I am pursuing Internet programming and development course in UCSC.I have around 2 Years of
    experience developing web application projects in JAVA technology. In my work most of the time I have spent working on backend stuffs
    I have very little knowledge about Frontedn styling validation. I wanted to know how things work. To learn more about styling I have enrolled
    in Desinging Cascading stlye sheet fundamentals.

    Here is my favourite concept in JAVA:
    The collections framework was designed to meet several goals, such as âˆ’
    The framework had to be high-performance. The implementations for the fundamental collections (dynamic arrays, linked lists, trees, and hashtables) were to be highly efficient.
    The framework had to allow different types of collections to work in a similar manner and with a high degree of interoperability.
    The framework had to extend and/or adapt a collection easily.
    Towards this end, the entire collections framework is designed around a set of standard interfaces. Several standard implementations such as LinkedList, HashSet, and TreeSet, of these interfaces are provided that you may use as-is and you may also implement your own collection, if you choose.
    In computer science, in the context of data storage, serialization is the process of translating data structures or object state into a format that can be stored (for example, in a file or memory buffer) or transmitted (for example, across a network connection link) and reconstructed later (possibly in a different computer environment).[1] When the resulting series of bits is reread according to the serialization format, it can be used to create a semantically identical clone of the original object. For many complex objects, such as those that make extensive use of references, this process is not straightforward. Serialization of object-oriented objects does not include any of their associated methods with which they were previously linked.

    This process of serializing an object is also called marshalling an object.[2] The opposite operation, extracting a data structure from a series of bytes, is deserialization (which is also called unmarshalling).
    A collections framework is a unified architecture for representing and manipulating collections. All collections frameworks contain the following
