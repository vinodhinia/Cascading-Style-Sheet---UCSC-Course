<h2> Good things about JAVA</h2>
<h3> Vinodhini Asok Kumar - UCSC Extension</h3>
<h4>Internet Programming and Development</h4>
<p> Hello, I am Vinodhini I am pursuing Internet programming and development course in UCSC.I have around 2 Years of
    experience developing web application projects in JAVA technology. In my work most of the time I have spent working on backend stuffs
    I have very little knowledge about Frontedn styling validation. I wanted to know how things work. To learn more about styling I have enrolled
    in Desinging Cascading stlye sheet fundamentals.
</p>
<p class="special">
    Here is my favourite concept in JAVA:
    The collections framework was designed to meet several goals, such as −
    The framework had to be high-performance. The implementations for the fundamental collections (dynamic arrays, linked lists, trees, and hashtables) were to be highly efficient.
    The framework had to allow different types of collections to work in a similar manner and with a high degree of interoperability.
    The framework had to extend and/or adapt a collection easily.
</p>
<p>
    Towards this end, the entire collections framework is designed around a set of standard interfaces. Several standard implementations such as LinkedList, HashSet, and TreeSet, of these interfaces are provided that you may use as-is and you may also implement your own collection, if you choose.
    A collections framework is a unified architecture for representing and manipulating collections. All collections frameworks contain the following
</p>

    <ul>
    <li><h5>Interfaces</h5>  These are abstract data types that represent collections. Interfaces allow collections to be manipulated independently of the details of their representation. In object-oriented languages, interfaces generally form a hierarchy.</li>
    <li><h5>Implementations</h5> i.e., Classes − These are the concrete implementations of the collection interfaces. In essence, they are reusable data structures.</li>
    <li><h5>Algorithms</h5>  These are the methods that perform useful computations, such as searching and sorting, on objects that implement collection interfaces. The algorithms are said to be polymorphic: that is, the same method can be used on many different implementations of the appropriate collection interface.</li>
    </ul>
