<h2> Good things about JAVA</h2>
<h4>Internet Programming and Development</h4>
<p> Hello, I am Vinodhini I am pursuing Internet programming and development course in UCSC.I have around 2 Years of
    experience developing web application projects in JAVA technology. In my work most of the time I have spent working on backend stuffs
    I have very little knowledge about Frontedn styling validation. I wanted to know how things work. To learn more about styling I have enrolled
    in Desinging Cascading stlye sheet fundamentals.
</p>
<p>
    Here is my favourite concept in JAVA:
    The collections framework was designed to meet several goals, such as âˆ’
    The framework had to be high-performance. The implementations for the fundamental collections (dynamic arrays, linked lists, trees, and hashtables) were to be highly efficient.
    The framework had to allow different types of collections to work in a similar manner and with a high degree of interoperability.
    The framework had to extend and/or adapt a collection easily.
